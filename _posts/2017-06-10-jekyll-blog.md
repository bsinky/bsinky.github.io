I've decided to try out blogging using GitHub Pages and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  I haven't done anything with Ruby in the past, but Jekyll doesn't seem to require Ruby knowledge, and aside from a few hiccups installing `gem` packages before I realized  `bundle install` existed, it has been a pretty smooth process getting started.

Some things I really like about Jekyll so far:
 - After a `jekyll serve` I can edit files and they're automatically hot reloaded
 - [So many community made themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)!
 - I can write in any old text editor
   - I especially appreciate this, as I've been trying to learn `vim` lately, so writing blog posts is a good exercise in learning the motions and comands

[This site](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) was a *huge* help getting this blog off the ground.  After getting my feet wet with Jekyll, I was able to find a nice theme for this blog pretty quickly too, [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll).  I really like the simplicity of it, so I plan on sticking with Pixyll for the foreseeable future.  

Plus, getting Disqus integrated was *extremely* easy.  It was basically a one step process in the config - "Oh, you want to use Disqus? K, you're using Disqus" and **done**.  *Another plus*, the Disqus components just look so nice within Pixyll, it's basically perfect.

So, what now? Well, posts here might not be very frequent...depends if I have anything to write about.  I expect to publish mostly programming posts (C#, Python, and Javascript are very likely, and maybe my old friend [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) will make an appearance), but that might extend into game development, and from there video game centered posts are a very real possibility.  We'll see.  I'm looking forward to learning more about what can be done with Jekyll, and to writing posts here!
