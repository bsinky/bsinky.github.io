I'm going to try to complete a game for GitHub's GameOff 2017, a month long game jam that will run until the end of November.

However, it's now past the end of day 3 in the jam, and the struggle feels very real! The theme of the jam is "throwback," which sounds great...but I have been lacking for inspiration on *what* sort of game to actually make.

The good news is, I'm not alone.  [efriedman3](https://github.com/efriedman3) and I are planning on entering the GameOff as a team! Hopefully as we get a little further into the month we're able to bounce ideas for a game back and forth and find something that sticks.

Aside from the gamedev's block I've been facing so far, efriedman3 and I are also currently planning on using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org) for the game.  We haven't come to a final decision on whether to go for a 2D or 3D game yet.  That will come once we get more used to Godot, and after the beginning concepts of our game start to come together.

As for learning Godot, so far it's been alright.  I've been working through the tutorial documentation slowly, I took a screenshot of the "game" I've been making so far.

Clearly, it is a masterpiece, and a contender for game of the year 2017.  By clicking one of the buttons, you can spawn a bowling ball, and the label of the rightmost penel increments with each frame.  Very strong gameplay all around I would say.

Also, witness below my Godot-guru status:

Jokes aside, I am enjoying working with Godot.  I'm taking things slowly, but the concepts so far seem simple, yet flexible.  The integrated editor for GDScript likewise has been working well, providing helpful auto-completion options based on the current context.  Hopefully using Godot will remain a good option, but only time will tell.
