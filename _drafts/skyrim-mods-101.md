## Introduction

Skyrim is one of my all time favorite games, and today we're going to do a write up on getting started playing with mods!

Skyrim is good even in its un-modded, vanilla form.  But *with* mods, Skyrim is an *incredible* experience.

Mods for Skyrim can range from whimsical...

...to epic, DLC-sized addons - available entirely free of cost[^1], and made by passionate fans.  Pictured here is the map of the wholly new Falskaar area, from [the mod of the same name](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37994/?).

So, how does one begin playing Skyrim with mods? Read on, and find out!

## Getting Started

The first decision to be made, which version of the game to play.  The remastered **Skyrim Special Edition** (hereafter known as **SSE**), or the **Original Skyrim**?

There are pros and cons to each.

**Original Skyrim** has a *huge* catalog of mods available.  There's a good chance that whatever you want your Skyrim experience to be, there's an Original Skyrim mod to do it.  Other pros for Original Skyrim, [Skyrim Script Extender](http://skse.silverlock.org/) (SKSE) is available, and is required for some *very* nice mods, such as [SkyUI](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?), [RaceMenu](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?), and many others.  We'll get into SKSE and those mods in more detail later.  For now, just know that SKSE is available *only* for Original Skyrim at this time, and it allows modders to do things that they would otherwise be unable to.

The *downsides* of Original Skyrim are that while it is possible to install graphical mods like [RealVision ENB](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30936/?)[^2] and mod the game where it looks potentially *better* than SSE, unless you have a very powerful gaming rig be prepared to make *huge* performance sacrifices[^3].

SSE is still fairly new.  Releasing on October 27th, 2016, as of this writing the game isn't yet a year old, so the modding community for SSE hasn't had time to catch up to Original Skyrim.  That said, many very good mods for Original Skyrim *have* been converted to work with Skyrim Special Edition, such as [Immersive Armors](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479/), [Alternate Start - Live Another Life](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272/?), and [Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090/?).

The *downsides* of SSE are nearly opposite of Original Skyrim - the game should run more smoothly, even with quite a few mods, *but*, as mentioned earlier, the catalog of mods available is nowhere near the size of the Original Skyrim.

Once you've decided what version of the game you will be playing, it's time for the real work to begin - downloading mods!

## Downloading and Installing Mods

The biggest site for finding Skyrim mods is [Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/games/?).  There's a section of the site for each supported game.  So, [the Skyrim Nexus](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/?) is where you'll go for Original Skyrim, and [the SSE Nexus](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/?) for SSE.

At this point in time[^4], I highly recommend downloading [Nexus Mod Manager](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/modmanager/?), known as NMM.  NMM makes it very easy to download mods from Nexus, and in addition supports the installation scripts that some mods[^5] use.  Once you install NMM, you should be able to downloads mods with one click by clicking "Download (NMM)" from the page of the mod or from its "Files" tab ("Download With Manager" there), if it supports the feature.  The following instructions will assume you are using NMM.

## LOOT - sorting your load order

![image]({{ site.url }}/images/skyrim-mods-101/loot.png)

[LOOT](https://loot.github.io/) is an absolute *requirement* in my book, no matter how many mods you are using or intend to use.  You'll want to download and install the latest release from the linked site at this point.

As the LOOT site describes it, LOOT is able to sort your mod load order automatically in order to provide you a stable game that won't crash[^6], even when you load it full of hundreds of mods.

## My Mod Recommendations

Last but not least, here's a selection of my favorite mods, including those I've mentioned earlier.  Obvious there's a personal bias here, and my play-style won't fit all tastes.  These should at least be an idea of where to get started though!

**Note:** For Original Skyrim, I've marked mods that require SKSE with [SKSE].  I've also marked SKSE itself as such.  The same applies to with SkyUI, these are marked [SkyUI].

### Original Skyrim Mods
 * [SKSE][SkyUI] [A Matter of Time](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44091/?)
 * [A Quality World Map and Solstheim Map - With Roads](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4929/?)

 * [SKSE][SkyUI] [Dual Sheathe Redux](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34155/?)
   * This mod is really cool, but installing it is quite a process.
 * [Falskaar](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37994/?)
 * [SKSE][SkyUI] [Footprints](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22745/?)
   * I'm not *entirely* sure if SKSE and SkyUI are required, but having them will allow you to configure this mod within the game.
 * [Helgen Reborn](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35841/?)
 * [Immersive Armors](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733/?)
 * [Immersive Weapons](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27644/?)

 * [KS Hairdos Renewal](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?)
 * [SKSE] [Perkus Maximum](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59849/?)
   * Another one that is harder to install, but really changes the game experience and is worth a try!
 * [SKSE] [QuickLoot](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73096/?)
   * I *highly* recommend this one!
 * [SKSE] [RaceMenu](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?)
 * [Realistic Water Two](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41076/?)

 * [RS Children Overhaul](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55555/?)
 * [SKSE] [ShowRaceMene Precache Killer](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33526/?t)

### SSE Mods

 * [The Forgotten City](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179/?)
   * I haven't played this personally, but my fianc&eacute; enjoyed it, and it seemed like a cool concept!
 * [Helgen Reborn](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673/?)
 * [Immersive Armors](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479/)
 * [KS Hairdos SSE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817/?)
   * Since this adds so many female hairstyles, be warned that switching sex to female in the character creation will probably lock up your game for a *while*, as the 100s of new hairs are loaded at that point.
 * [Lanterns of Skyrim SE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2429/?)
 * [Open Cities Skyrim](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/281/?)
   * Very cool mod, but you may need compatibility patches for this to work for other mods, like Falskaar for example.
 * [RS Children Overhaul](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2650/?)
 * [Total Character Makeover](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1037/?)
 * [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/?)

[^1]: Although, the "free of cost" aspect may only be due to the fact that modders cannot legally charge for their created content.  At least, not currently, but the upcoming [Creation Club](https://bethesda.net/en/article/3lO9zYi5QksEqwUoYowAMs/fallout-4-and-skyrim-special-edition-creation-club)  will presumably change that.  That's *not* a topic I'll be addressing here though. 

[^2]: There are many, many ENB presets out there.  I've always been happy with RealVision - the performance to prettiness ratio is right where I want it.  That said, though I've never used it myself, the screenshots for [Tetrachromatic ENB](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73848/?) look ***great***!.

[^3]: For reference, with the mods I use in Original Skyrim (including RealVision ENB), I get **at best** 30FPS when outside in Skyrim.  This is on a GTX970 and Intel i5-4690k (running at the base 3.5 GHz).

[^4]: Once upon a time, I would have whole-heartedly recommended [ModOrganizer](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/?) instead, as it has the same features as NMM and more nice things on top of that.  The original developer has stopped worked on it though, and to be honest I haven't followed it since then.  Plus, it doesn't seem to support SSE well either (although it appears there's a [fork](https://github.com/LePresidente/modorganizer/releases) of the project on GitHub by a new developer working on SSE support).  The nice thing about NMM is that it works equally well for both Original and SSE.

[^5]: A lot of mods use these to let you turn various mod features on or off during installation, or to install compatibility patches based on other mods you're using.  They're very useful!

[^6]: To be fair, the game will still probably crash from time to time.  **But** without a properly sorted load order it would crash even more!
