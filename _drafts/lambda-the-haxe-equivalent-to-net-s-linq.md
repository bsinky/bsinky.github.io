excerpt: |
    Most anyone whoâ€™s written C# in the last 9 years has probably heard of LINQ. I would imagine most of those people have also written a few LINQ statements in that time; the language feature is just too useful to pass up!

    As a frequent user of the Haxe language, I recently stumbled upon Lambda. From the linked documentation:

    The Lambda class is a collection of methods to support functional programming. It is ideally used with using Lambda and then acts as an extension to Iterable types.

    On static platforms, working with the Iterable structure might be slower than performing the operations directly on known types, such as Array and List.

    One thing to note - the second paragraph does indicate that using Lambda may result in a performance penalty on static targets. But, if this is acceptable within your application, Lambda is likely to be very useful. This is especially true of C# developers who are used to LINQ - and that brings us to the main point of this article!

Most anyone who's written C# in the last 9 years[^1] has probably heard of LINQ.  I would imagine most of those people have also *written* a few LINQ statements in that time; the language feature is just too useful to pass up!

As a frequent[^2] user of the Haxe language, I recently stumbled upon [Lambda](http://api.haxe.org/Lambda.html).  From the linked documentation:

> The Lambda class is a collection of methods to support functional programming. It is ideally used with using Lambda and then acts as an extension to Iterable types.

> On static platforms, working with the Iterable structure might be slower than performing the operations directly on known types, such as Array and List.

One thing to note - the second paragraph does indicate that using Lambda *may* result in a performance penalty on static targets.  But, if this is acceptable within your application, Lambda is likely to be *very* useful.  This is especially true of C# developers who are used to LINQ - and that brings us to the main point of this article!

# Lambda - the Haxe equivalent of .NET's LINQ
{:.no_toc}

In the code snippets that follow, the Haxe code will assume that `using Lambda` was specified, just as the C# code will assume the use of `import System.Linq` to utilize the static extension methods for `IEnumerable`.

Each section header will follow the format `LINQ Method Name => Lambda Method Name`, with the C# code example first, followed by the Haxe code example.


**Note on Haxe arrow function:** the Haxe code examples will be using standard anonymous functions for predicate functions.  Those looking for a more terse syntax will be happy to know that the next version of Haxe, Haxe 4, [will contain arrow functions](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.0.0-preview.1/).

Until the (stable) release of Haxe 4, arrow functions are also available via a few libraries on `haxelib`, such as `slambda` or `hxslam`.

## Where => filter

To start off, here's an example of using `Where` in C# to find all the even numbers in a collection:

```csharp
var someInts = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var onlyEvens = someInts.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
```

To accomplish the same in Haxe, we can use Lambda's `filter`:

```as3
var someInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var onlyEvens = someInts.filter(function(n) n % 2 == 0);
```

[filter demo](https://try.haxe.org/#F39eE)

## FirstOrDefault => find


LINQ:

```csharp
var someInts = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var divisibleByThree = someInts.FirstOrDefault(n => n % 3 == 0);
```

Lambda:

```as3
var someInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var divisibleByThree = someInts.find(function(n) return n % 3 == 0);
```

## Single


## Any => exists / empty

A few remarks on this one; LINQ's `Any` has 2 overloads, one which accepts a predicate, and one which does not.  For the example that accepts a predicate, Lambda's `exists` will do.

LINQ:

```csharp
var someInts = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var anyEvenNumbers = someInts.Any(n => n % 2 == 0);
```

Lambda:

```as3
var someInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var anyEvenNumbers = someInts.exists(function(n) return n % 2 == 0);
```

For the `Any` overload that does not accept a predicate, Lambda's `empty` is the answer.

LINQ:

```csharp
var someInts = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var anyNumbers = someInts.Any(); // no predicate; "does the IEnumerable contain anything?"
```

Lambda:

```as3
var someInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var anyNumbers = !someInts.empty(); // empty is simply the inverse of Any with no parameters.
```

## Contains => has

LINQ:

```csharp
var someInts = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var containsThree = someInts.Contains(3);
```
Lambda:

```as3
var someInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var containsThree = someInts.has(3);
```

## Select => map

LINQ:

```csharp
var someInts = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var squares = someInts.Select(n => n * n); // this is IEnumerable!
```
For the Lambda example, note that `map` returns a `List`, so it's *slightly* different from LINQ where the return value of `Select` is still a deferred execution `IEnumerable`.

```as3
var someInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var squares = someInts.map(function(n) return n * n); // this is a List!
```

### Select => mapi (Bonus round!)

The overload for `Select` with the signature `Select<TSource>(IEnumerable<TSource>, Func<TSource, Int32, TResult>)`, in which the second argument to the `selector` parameter is the index of the element from the source collection **also** has a corresponding Lambda counterpart, `mapi`.

LINQ:

```csharp
var someInts = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var indexAndInt = someInts.Select(index, n => $"{index}: {n}"); // this is IEnumerable!
```

Lambda:

```as3
var someInts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var indexAndInt = someInts.mapi(function(index, n) return '${index}: ${n}'); // this is a List!
```

## SelectMany => flatten

```csharp
var listOfLists = new [] { new[] { 1, 2, 3 }, new[] { 4, 5, 6 }, new[] {7, 8, 9}};
var flattenedList = listOfLists.SelectMany(n => n);
```

For the Lambda example, note that `flatten` returns a `List` instead of a concatenated `Iterable`.  Also, `flatten` accepts no arguments - it *always* simply flattens the `Iterable<Iterable<A>>` into a single `List`, no `selector` function required.

```as3
var listOfLists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]];
var flattenedList = listOfLists.flatten();
```

## Aggregate => fold



## Count => count

In this case, both LINQ and Lambda methods seem to behave exactly the same.

## ToList => list

This one is straightforward - LINQ's `ToList` returns `List`, Lambda's `list` returns `List`.  Nothing else to say here!

## ToArray => array

In this case, both LINQ and Lambda methods seem to behave exactly the same.

## Concat => concat

In this case, both LINQ and Lambda methods seem to behave *similarly*, but it should be noted that, again, the result of LINQ's `Concat` is `IEnumerable` while the result of Lambda's `concat` is a concrete `List` and not simply an `Iterable`.

## Final Notes

To close, let's take a look at a few last examples, starting off at a slightly less basic level and ending at an exapmle that isn't so basic and contrived, and may actually prove useful.  Additionally, I hope this helps to prove the power and utility of Lambda!

Our first task: Square all numbers 1 to 100, then find all the squares divisible by 4.  Notice here how both LINQ and Lambda allow you to chain several methods to build up a computation.

LINQ:

```csharp
var squaresDivisibleBy4 = Enumerable.Range(1, 100).Select(n => n * n)
    .Where(n => n % 4 == 0)
    .ToArray();
```

Lambda:

```as3
// Array comprehensions accomplish the same as Enumerable.Range
var list1To100 = [for (n in 1...101) n];
var squaresDivisibleBy4 = list1To100.map(function(n) return n * n)
    .filter(function(n) return n % 4 == 0)
    .array();
```

[^1]: LINQ was first introduced with the release of .NET Framework 3.5, on November 19th, 2017.

[^2]: Though, I am clearly still discovering new parts of the standard library.
